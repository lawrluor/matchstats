  <h3>Recent Updates</h3>

  <h4> June 25, 2015 </h5>
  <ul>
    <li> implemented Character-User functions from Character class, and updated unit test (tests.py) </li>
    <li> implemented creation of secondaries column from /create_user when creating User. Hardcoded database of Character objects </li>
    <li> revised user_create form to allow secondaries character selection using checkboxes. Performed tests and bugfixing for secondaries and revised other templates </li>
    <li> /create_user now doesn't add main character to secondaries if that character is selected in both user_main and user_secondaries </li>
    <li> created sub-template user_display and revised relevant templates to include it </li>
    <li> /character now displays Users who secondary the character </li>
  </ul>

  <h4> June 24, 2015 </h4>
  <ul>
    <li> NOTE: large bug: werkzeug.routing.BuildError, when viewing /browse_users and /browse_regions when it claims that the route to /region/region when displaying a user (tag, region, main) doesn't exist. This is actually because it is being passed a parameter of None from a new User who does not have the attribute region filled out, so the route is essentially /region/None rather than /region/region. The same holds true for other empty yet required attributes. Clear the database of these types of objects </li>
    <li> optimized /head_to_head, and now checks for query string variable existence first </li>
    <li> /head_to_head form fields now populated with player tags of currently viewed head to head </li>
    <li> /user_create now requests for character main using a dropdown (SelectField) list. optimized forms.py </li>
    <li> added Characters as Model, Secondaries as relationship table between Characters and Users </li>
    <li> fixed User functions for querying and displaying User.secondaries </li>
    <li> revised User-Character functions, updated unit test (tests.py) </li>

    <li> Users now explicitly ordered by user_id in /browse_users. Sets now explicitly ordered by set_id in /browse_sets; sets displayed on user and head to head pages now explicitly ordered by set_id </li>
    <li> changed /region route to /browse_regions for consistency, and changed all related templates and routes to support that </li>
    <li> implemented /browse_characters page where one may view all the game's characters in tier list order, which route to users who play that character </li>
