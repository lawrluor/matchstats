    <!-- <div><h3><a href="{{url_for("browse_tournaments")}}">Browse Recent Tournaments</a></h3></div> -->
    <p>Smashstats tracks the stats of tournament-level players in the eSports Super Smash Bros. Melee scene. It parses data from tournament brackets and neatly presents statistics of tournament attendance, comprehensive set records, and head to head histories between players.</p>

    <p>Currently, Smashstats only accepts bracket data from Challonge, meaning that no match information is automatically generated. Additionally, no player information is automatically entered besides their tag and set history; this information includes region, main, and secondary characters. The tournament database currently holds final bracket data for all Nationals since 2015.</p>
