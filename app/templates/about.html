    <h1>About SmashStats</h1>
    <p> This is a local version of live smashstats for claremont. that is all. </p>

    <p>The application recognizes and sorts players by tag, and associates them with the sets and tournaments they have played in. Once players have been recorded in the database, the program attempts to match all references to them to their tag. Currently, Smashstats only accepts bracket data from Challonge, meaning that no match information can be automatically generated. Additionally, player information about regions, main, and secondary characters requires input from the larger community.</p>

    <p><b>In its current state, SmashStats does not claim to represent a fully comprehensive record of all players' set and tournament histories, but rather is a proof of concept for widespread stats tracking.</b></p>

    <p>If you are interested in this project and would like to contribute, contact the developers at <a href="mailto:smashstats@example.com"><b>smashstats@gmail.com</b></a>, or connect with us through our social media accounts.</p>

      <h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>
    </div>

    <div class="panel-body">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4><b>Where are you getting this information?</b></h4>
          The app scrapes Challonge and Smashgg brackets and stores information in a database, altogether a completely automated process.
          <ul>
            <li><h4><b>What types of tournament bracket programs do you support?</b></h4>
              Currently, just Challonge and Smashgg, but progress is being made on parsing Liquipedia for detailed match info.
            </li>

            <li><h4><b>Is tournament bracket data accurate?</b></h4></li>
              We can only work with whatever is provided on the bracket. If a tournament only has a final bracket, we'd rather process what data we have than exclude it because it lacks completion.
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4><b>How are ratings calculated?</b></h4>
          Trueskill, which estimates your skill based on who you've won and lost to. Tournament attendance is a slight factor, though a much bigger one for players with very low set counts. Read more about it <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html"><b>here</b></a>

          <ul>
            <li><h4><b>Do tournament placements matter?</b></h4></li>
            No, they do not. Rating is solely based on who you've won and lost to, and your relative ratings at the time of the set.

            <li><h4><b>Are DQ (disqualification) sets taken into account? How about the margin of victory?</b></h4><li>
            DQ scores, if reported properly in Challonge (commonly a score of -1 or 0-0), are not taken into account. We do record the set match score, but only the outcome of a set, win or loss, is factored into rankings.

            <li><h4><b>What are the difference between Global and Regional Rankings?</b></h4></li>
            <b>AS OF 8/12:</b> If you play someone from a different region than you, only your Global trueskill updates, but if you play someone from the same region, only your Region trueskill updates. This holds true regardless of the type or size of the tournament. 

            <li><h4><b>How many sets per player are taken into rating?</b></h4>
            Currently, all sets a player has ever played. This is subject to change in the future, to the last (most recent) x number of sets.
            </li>

            <li><h4><b>Why do some tournaments have placements that suddenly jump into the thousandths?</b></h4>
            Unless it's EVO, those are pool placements. For example, 7th in your pool grants you a 1007th placing. Players are not assigned a pool placement if they advanced to the final bracket, and instead only have a final bracket placement, as only one placement per tournament is permitted.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4><b>How do you account for players who may use alternate tags in different tournaments?</b></h4>
          The application automatically can detect different spellings and different team/sponsor information for players, provided a player registers his/her tag. If a player uses completely different tags between tournaments, the application can remember alternate names, but that number will be limited to prevent abuse of the system. Players can also be merged after a tournament is processed.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4><b>Seems that I'm listed under multiple tags - I thought the program would automatically do this?</h4></b>
              If you haven't explicitly registered a tag with the program, it won't automatically match tags to it. It will attempt, however, to match players with differences in tag capitalization and team/sponsor information. If you've already told me your main/alternate tags, let me know and I'll fix it and merge the player instances.
            </li>

            </li>
              <h4><b>Why don't you display sponsor or team tags?</b></h4>
              It helps for the program to consistently recognize and identify players whose tags in bracket may differ from tournament to tournament. It also reduces the need for maintenance whenever a player changes team or sponsor.
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4><b>How do you deal with people from different regions having the same tag?</b></h4>
              In these instances, their tag will be suffixed by their region's name, i.e. FalcoMaster3000 [NorCal]. As for players in the same region having the same tag, that is probably an issue that should be addressed outside of this app.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><h4><b>There seems to be some missing information on the page. Can I help?</b></h4></li>
          Yes! Only so much can be done through automation, so info like player's alternate tags, characters, sometimes tournament's dates, and more need to be provided by the community. We can only automatically offer what we scrape from tournament brackets. Please tweet at us or contact us using our media links at the bottom of the page if you can offer any info!
          <ul>
            <li><h4><b>Why do some tournaments take place in 20XX?</b></h4></li>
            Because they year is... Actually though, those dates are automatically entered if the program can't locate a date for a bracket automatically, so that the community can easily spot them and fix them with the correct info.
          </ul>

         <li>
          <h4><b>Why is my rating so low?</b></h4>
          git gud kid. (But players with a very low amount of played sets tend to ranked very low, and have skill ratings that tend to fluctuate more.)
          <ul>
            <li><h4><b>I think some of my results are not being represented.</b></h4></li>
             Your region may not be supported, or we lack data for that particular tournament. If not, check the profile page for your tag. If there are tournaments that you've entered that are listed in the database but not on your page, chances are your tag wasn't recognized. You can also try searching for your alternate tags or tournaments you've entered. Let us know if you think there's an issue.

            <li><h4><b>I play in different regions frequently. Which region should I be listed under?</li></h4></b>
            You should consider yourself as part of the region you currently enter the most tournaments in.
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4><b>How can I get my region on here?</b></h4>
          If you are a prominent TO in your area, get in contact with us through our email or social media at the bottom of the page
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4><b>Who are the creators of SmashStats?</b></h4>
          <a href="{{url_for('user', tag='Tonic [New England]')}}"><b>Tonic</b></a>, a Marth main based in New England, and Wyne, a Falco player studying in SoCal.
